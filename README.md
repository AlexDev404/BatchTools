# BatchTools
The classic BatchTools that includes all the hard to find tools like graphic.exe, ctext.exe, colous.exe, etc.

You won't be able to find these applications anywhere else (unless you are a digger like me).
All these applications listed here are either extinct or nonexistent anymore.
These applications provide you to create a multitude of games and software.
If you are a person who like retro (like me), these are the right tools for you. With these you are able to create batch-style games, etc.
